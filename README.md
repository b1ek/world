    otherworld - a zola theme
</h1>

you can see the demo [here](https://world.blek.codes)

## how to use

### prerequisities
1. a linux system. you can use windows for that, but this guide centers itself on linux based systems.
2. you need to have these programs installed: `git` and `zola`
3. some creativity, html and scss skills

### steps
#### 1. clone the repo
(aka download the theme)

lets assume that your website's directory name in `daftpunk`. it will appear in commands a few times, and you should replace it with your website's name.

```sh
$ git clone git@git.blek.codes:blek/otherworld.git daftpunk
$ cd daftpunk
```

#### 2. open an another terminal
in the same directory, run

```sh
$ zola serve
```

#### 3. edit files in the `content` directory...
