So the story is pretty simple: i wanted to build a social network just for fun, but then i thought that i might want to build other things than that so i started building an SSO before that.

But then i found out that OIDC (OpenID Connect) exists so i forgot about this.  
And then i started working on something else so i didnt even make the social network.
