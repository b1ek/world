Its this website!! It is actually a redesign of the old version which i think i might keep [here](https://old-1.blek.codes) (expect this link to be dead). You can also check out the archive.org archived copies.

It is built on [zola](https://getzola.org), which generates static .HTML files you can put anywhere.

I used a tenor gif as a background and some CSS tweaks to make it look funny.

Seriously, there isn't much to this website since you have probably explored it already. One thing worth mentioning is that there is no longer any guestbook for the following reasons:  
- I have no time nor the will to moderate it
- This is basically a bunch of static .HTML files, duh. No backend.
