A minecraft launcher for my server. It has custom license which will in no way survive in court and is built on WinForms of all things.

The minecraft server project has failed since i had almost zero interest for it.

It does its job, though. Like, it has been written before microsoft accounts for minecraft so you probably couldn't log in, but you can run minecraft from it.

I wasnt planning on open sourcing this since it had a cheat detection protocol built in, but who the hell cares now.
