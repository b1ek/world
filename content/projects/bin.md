A simple ass pastebin copy. Also has a funny HTML-only captcha that has not been cracked so far.

It is built on express and stores data in simple files.

I was inspired by [librebin](https://github.com/hnhx/librebin) to build this. Since it sucks. Serously, the code is written in a no-framework php. Should i elaborate eny further?
