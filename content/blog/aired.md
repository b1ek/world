The new website is aired at [blek.codes](https://blek.codes)! Yaaay

FYI, almost everything I make is open source (with this website being no exception), so heres the [git repo](https://git.blek.codes/blek/world.git) for yall in case you wanna see whats under the hood.

## What's new?
1. A funny vaporwave-like redesign
2. The website is fully static - you can even download it via smth like `wget -r`
3. Its fully NO-JS!! I mean, the previous versions were NOJS as well, but still its pretty awesome.

Also there won't be any guestbook for a while since as i mentioned before, this stack is fully static - basically just a bunch of .HTML files.
