to be honestly, the only thing i ever want to do with my life is to sit my whole life in some dense place like berlin or something, sit at coffee shops with my friends, talk about stuff and maybe do some hacktivist stuff.
would be really nice to do something really big (kinda like mr robot, iykyk)

i dont think i could make it, but might as well try.

also it would be fun to go on a date to some abandoned building ^^ i really like the aesthetic and stuff

btw, i dont think that my death protcol would actually work. like, it might but it probably simply won't. i really need to rethink it. maybe rebuild it so it would be simple as fuck. i dont know

i feel like i should re arrange the stuff on the index page.
