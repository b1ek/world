i flew just a lil bit in my life, and only on one airline so i probably shouldn't be all pissy at all airlines. but seriously, why can't they just wash them properly? i asked for a blanket at a plane and it had hairs and stuff on it.

like i paid 800$ for a single ticket. is that too much effort to wash them every time they fly? i also heard someone asking for a blanket in the end of the flight and the attendant said they didnt have any left. so, there it is again.
